keep it alive
=============

Idea 1
------

Little shop of horrors inspired!
Spreadsheet game in which you choose victims to feed to your talking carnivorous plant.
You are scored based on the morality of your choices.

 - present as visual novel?
 - minigame where you have to actually abduct your chosen victim?
 - choose between adbucting and killing people who are bad, but whose disappearance is
   more likely to implicate you, or people who are good, but safe?
 - some choices benefit the player, e.g. kill your boss, get a promotion?

This is a puzzle game, so it's not enough to present a list of choices, with the best
one being obvious. Nor is it a satifying puzzle to present an ambiguous list of choices
where the ambiguity comes from clashing moral priorities, and have the player guess the
developer's view on morality.

So I think it has to be a tradeoff between on the one hand doing the moral thing
and on the other keeping the plant alive as long as possible without being caught.

 - variables:
    - weight: the more someone weighs, the longer their body can feed the plant
       - IMPORTANT: don't be fat-phobic! People can also be heavy by being swole
         (or by being in groups)
    - security: if the person is guarded, you'll be likely caught trying to abduct them
    - popularity: the more popular a person is, the more resources the police will put
      into investigating them.

    - goodness: flavour and score?

As the game progresses, the plant grows larger and larger, which means you have to
kill heavier and heavier people. The game ends naturally when you can't feed the plant
enough and it eats you?

Three stages of plant largness:
 - small plant: dies by withering away
 - medium plant: ?
 - large plant: dies by eating you

Turns out managing the pool of people so that it doesn't fill up with lightweights is
challenging. We need mechanics that interact with the pool!

 - Popularity: People don't necessarily replace themselves. If a person is popular,
   their friends come looking for them. Popularity should anticorrelate with weight, maybe?
   Ooof, what a striking social commentary.

 - What we really want is the ability to purge dead weight. Maybe people wander away of
   their own accord?
